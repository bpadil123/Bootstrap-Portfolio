                            <p>Hello World! I'm sure that gets old... Welcome to my portfolio. I was born and raised in a small
                                beautiful town in New Mexico, Santa Fe. I obtained my Bachelors in Operations & Markering
                                just an hour from home at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. I have worked with
                                Fortune 500 companies since I was a sophmore in college. From providing tech support at Apple
                                to working in Project Management at HP Inc, I have had my fair share of fun with Corporate
                                America. I am a seeker of new knowledge which has brought me to the development world.
                            </p>
                            <p>Outside of my professional life, you can find me mountain biking, running, dancing at concerts,
                                and crusing the city on my road bike. I love the outdoors, although you can occasionally
                                find me binging a television series from time to time. Music is the soundtrack to life and
                                I hold my tunes dearly as I work and play.
                            </p>
                            <p>My infatuation with technology has never been so difficult until I began programming. That is
                                what excites me to walk this journey of creation and frustration! My passion to build and
                                create is growing by the day as new material is being shoved at me. Perhaps I will travel
                                the world and work with a diverse range of indiduals, or simply continue to sit at a desk
                                potentially work on something exciting. I like the flexibility and freedom of what lies ahead!
                                To that, I say cheers devlopers!
